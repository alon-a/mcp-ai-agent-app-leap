# Requirements Document: MCP Unified Interface Integration

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for integrating the MCP Assistant App (web-based interactive interface) with the MCP Server Builder (Python-based automation framework) into a unified user interface. The goal is to provide users with both simple quick-generation capabilities and comprehensive production-ready server building through a single, cohesive interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified User Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access both simple MCP server generation and advanced production-ready server building from a single web interface, so that I can choose the appropriate level of complexity for my needs without switching between different tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the unified interface THEN they SHALL see options for both "Quick Generate" and "Advanced Build" modes
2. WHEN a user selects "Quick Generate" mode THEN the system SHALL provide the current MCP Assistant App functionality with immediate TypeScript/Node.js code generation
3. WHEN a user selects "Advanced Build" mode THEN the system SHALL provide access to the full MCP Server Builder capabilities including multi-language support, production configurations, and comprehensive validation
4. WHEN a user switches between modes THEN the interface SHALL maintain context and allow seamless transitions
5. WHEN a user is in either mode THEN they SHALL have access to the AI chat assistant for guidance and support

### Requirement 2: Backend Integration Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the web application to seamlessly integrate with the Python-based MCP Server Builder, so that users can access advanced automation capabilities through the web interface without requiring Python knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives an advanced build request THEN it SHALL communicate with the MCP Server Builder Python API through a secure bridge interface
2. WHEN the Python MCP Server Builder is processing a request THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates to the web interface
3. WHEN the MCP Server Builder completes a project THEN the system SHALL make the generated files available for download through the web interface
4. WHEN the MCP Server Builder encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages and recovery options in the web interface
5. WHEN multiple users are using the system concurrently THEN each user's projects SHALL be isolated and managed independently

### Requirement 3: Progressive Complexity Interface

**User Story:** As a user with varying MCP development experience, I want the interface to guide me from simple to complex configurations, so that I can learn and grow my capabilities while using the same tool.

4. WHEN a user configures a project THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent defaults and validation for all configuration options
5. WHEN a user has complex configuration requirements THEN the system SHALL support both form-based and JSON/YAML configuration editing

### Requirement 6: File Management and Download

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily browse, preview, and download generated project files through the web interface, so that I can quickly access and deploy my MCP servers without needing command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project is generated THEN the system SHALL provide a file browser interface showing the complete project structure
2. WHEN a user selects a file THEN the system SHALL display a preview with syntax highlighting and formatting
3. WHEN a user wants to download files THEN the system SHALL provide options to download individual files or the complete project as a ZIP archive
4. WHEN a user wants to modify generated files THEN the system SHALL provide basic editing capabilities with validation
5. WHEN a user creates multiple projects THEN the system SHALL maintain a project history with easy access to previous generations

### Requirement 7: Multi-Language Support Integration

**User Story:** As a developer working with different programming languages, I want to generate MCP servers in Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, or Java through the same interface, so that I can use consistent tooling regardless of my technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects advanced build mode THEN they SHALL be able to choose from all supported programming languages (Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java)
2. WHEN a user selects a programming language THEN the system SHALL show appropriate framework options and configuration settings
3. WHEN a user generates a project in any language THEN the system SHALL provide language-specific documentation and setup instructions
4. WHEN a user switches between languages THEN the system SHALL preserve compatible configuration options and provide migration guidance
5. WHEN a user needs language-specific help THEN the AI assistant SHALL provide contextual guidance for the selected technology stack
