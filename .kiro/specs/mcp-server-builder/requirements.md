# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an automated MCP (Model Context Protocol) server builder that can set up a complete MCP server environment. The solution will handle folder creation, file downloads, proper file placement, and execution of build commands to create a functional MCP server from scratch.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically create a new MCP server project structure, so that I can quickly bootstrap MCP server development without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates MCP server creation THEN the system SHALL create a new project folder with the specified name
2. WHEN creating the project structure THEN the system SHALL create all necessary subdirectories for a standard MCP server layout
3. WHEN the folder structure is created THEN the system SHALL ensure proper permissions are set for all directories

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to download and place all required MCP server files, so that I have a complete working foundation without manual file management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloading files THEN the system SHALL retrieve all necessary MCP server template files from appropriate sources
2. WHEN placing files THEN the system SHALL put each file in its correct location within the project structure
3. WHEN file operations complete THEN the system SHALL verify that all required files are present and accessible
4. IF any file download fails THEN the system SHALL report the specific error and continue with remaining files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically configure the MCP server with proper dependencies, so that the server is ready to run without additional setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up dependencies THEN the system SHALL install all required packages and libraries
2. WHEN configuring the server THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate configuration files with default settings
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL verify that all installations completed successfully
4. IF dependency installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggested remediation steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to execute build commands automatically, so that the MCP server is compiled and ready to use immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the server THEN the system SHALL execute all necessary build commands in the correct sequence
2. WHEN build commands run THEN the system SHALL capture and display build output for debugging purposes
3. WHEN the build completes successfully THEN the system SHALL verify that all expected artifacts are generated
4. IF any build step fails THEN the system SHALL halt the process and provide detailed error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to specify custom configuration options for my MCP server, so that it meets my specific project requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a server THEN the system SHALL accept optional configuration parameters from the user
2. WHEN custom options are provided THEN the system SHALL apply them to the appropriate configuration files
3. WHEN no custom options are specified THEN the system SHALL use sensible default values
4. WHEN configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL validate that all settings are compatible and valid

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide clear feedback during the setup process, so that I can monitor progress and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the setup process runs THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators for each major step
2. WHEN each step completes THEN the system SHALL log the completion status and any relevant details
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with actionable guidance
4. WHEN the entire process completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of what was created and next steps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to validate the completed MCP server setup, so that I can be confident it will work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process completes THEN the system SHALL run basic validation tests on the MCP server
2. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL check that the server can start without errors
3. WHEN testing connectivity THEN the system SHALL verify that the MCP protocol endpoints respond correctly
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information to help resolve issues
