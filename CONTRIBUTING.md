## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Follow the existing code formatting and naming conventions
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep components small and focused

### Backend Development (Encore.ts)

- Each major feature should be organized as a service
- Use type-safe API endpoints with proper request/response schemas
- Follow Encore.ts best practices for service organization
- Add comprehensive error handling

### Frontend Development (React)

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow accessibility best practices

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PRs
- Test both frontend and backend components
- Include integration tests for critical paths

## Contribution Process

### 1. Fork and Branch

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Create a feature branch from `main`:
